List of Default Functions Provided by Mongoose
------------------------------------------------

When you create a model (which represents a table in MongoDB when using Mongoose), 
you get several default functions (methods) provided by Mongoose. 
These methods are typically accessible on the model object returned by mongoose.model() function. 
Here are some of the common default methods:

find(): Finds all documents that match the query parameters.
findById(): Finds a single document by its _id.
findOne(): Finds a single document that matches the query parameters.
findByIdAndUpdate(): Finds a document by its _id and updates it.
findByIdAndRemove(): Finds a document by its _id and removes it.
create(): Creates a new document instance and saves it to the database.
save(): Saves a document instance to the database.
updateOne(): Updates a single document that matches the query parameters.
updateMany(): Updates multiple documents that match the query parameters.
deleteOne(): Deletes a single document that matches the query parameters.
deleteMany(): Deletes multiple documents that match the query parameters.
countDocuments(): Returns the count of documents that match the query parameters.
aggregate(): Performs aggregation operations on the model's collection.


These methods are available by default on a Mongoose model object and allow you to interact with MongoDB collections easily.
